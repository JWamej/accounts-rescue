                 "	The main principle behind this project was to create an application designed to store login credentials for accounts that the user cannot afford to lose. To ensure the complete safety of the necessary data, follow these recommendations:\n"
                 "		1. Store the key and IV on a drive that is entirely disconnected from the main computer (e.g., a dedicated USB drive) and/or in physical form (e.g., a notebook).\n"
                 "		2. Create backups of the source file on separate drives (in case of drive failure) and/or on external drives (in case of ransomware attacks).\n")



faq = (""
       "Is it possible to recover login credentials without the key or IV?\n"
       "    No. The source file is completely encrypted, so unless the AES-256 encryption is compromised, the data is impossible to restore.\n\n"

       "Does using this application ensure security against attacks?\n"
       "    No system can be made completely impenetrable. Not even the best antivirus software or the most expensive password manager can protect against critical user errors.\n\n"

       "Does this application have any anti-keylogger functionality?\n"
       "    The application can only prevent direct access to unencrypted login credentials. It remains vulnerable to spyware attacks.\n\n")

            "   - Use this application to store accounts that do not require frequent accessâ€”there are better alternatives for frequent use.\n"
            "   - Never store the key and IV in the same location as the source file and application.\n")
